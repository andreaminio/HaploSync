# HaploSync - Ver. 1.0
Tools for haplotype-wise reconstruction of pseudomolecules

## Aim
The aim of the tool is improving continuity of a given genome draft assembly up to pseudomolecule representation using a closely relate species as guide to sort and direct the query sequences.  

![HaploSync Diagram](./manual/Workflows/Diagram.png)


HaploSync was developed to improve the quality of diploid genome assemblies. This tool:

* builds diploid pseudomolecule assemblies from draft sequences using a reference genome as a guide,
* enhances assembly contiguity,
* fills sequence gaps by comparing haplotypes independent of a reference,
* generates maps of the phased haplotypes,
* assesses the quality of assembled sequences, and
* edits sequences.
