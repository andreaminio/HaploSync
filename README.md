# HaploSync - Ver. 1.0
Tools for haplotype-wise reconstruction of pseudomolecules

## Aim
The aim of the tool is improving continuity of a given genome draft assembly up to pseudomolecule representation using a closely relate species as guide to sort and direct the query sequences.  

![HaploSync Diagram](./manual/Workflows/Diagram.png)

HaploSync was developed to improve the quality of diploid genome assemblies. This tool:

* Builds diploid pseudomolecule assemblies from draft sequences using:
  * a genetic map 
  * a chromosome scaled guide genome of a closely related species 
* Compares alternative haplotypes to identify and correct misassemblies independently from any reference
* Fills assembly gaps with un-placed sequences
* Resolves collapsed homozygous regions
