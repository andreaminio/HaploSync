# 3 - Manipulate genomic sequences

HaploBreak and HaploMake can be used to manipulate sequences and translate known annotations across assembly versions. Multiple tasks can be accomplished with these tools. Here are some usage examples.

## HaploBreak

1. [3.1 - Break scaffolds with errors](edit_sequences.4.md)

## HaploMake

1. [3.2 - Generate new sequences after gap filling with HaploFill](edit_sequences.5.md)
2. [3.3 - Select regions of interest](edit_sequences.1.md)
3. [3.4 - Convert annotation between versions](edit_sequences.2.md)
4. [3.5 - Upgrade sequences or generate _ad hoc_ loci from assemblies](edit_sequences.3.md)
